# Github Following tab as default extension

A Firefox extension that selects the "Following" tab by default instead of the "For you" tab in the main page when there is a logged user.

# Testing

To test the extension:

1. Go to `about:config`
2. Load the `manifest.json` file. 

Note: you will have to edit the manifest.json file and add the good js file. Now it uses a minified version.
